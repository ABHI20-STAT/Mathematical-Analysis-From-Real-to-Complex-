## 📘 Overview

Mathematical Analysis lies at the heart of modern mathematics and physics.  
This repository explores the journey from the **real line ℝ** to the **complex plane ℂ**, emphasizing both the **theoretical rigour** and the **geometric intuition** that unify these two analytical worlds.

The repository is divided into well-structured modules, each focusing on specific foundational and advanced topics, accompanied by:
- 💡 **Mathematical derivations and proofs**  
- 🧠 **Conceptual explanations and motivation**  
- 💻 **Computational demonstrations** (via Python/R/Mathematica notebooks)  
- 📊 **Visualizations and plots** for intuition building
