        "In complex analysis, the residue of a function at a point is a special number that captures how the function behaves near a singularity (a point where the function \"blows up\" or becomes undefined). Mathematically, it's the coefficient of the $\\frac{1}{z-z_0}$ term in the Laurent series expansion of the function around that point $𝑧_0$. Residues help us evaluate complex integrals easily. If you integrate a function around a closed loop that encloses singularities, the result depends only on the residues at those points—not the full function. This is the heart of the Cauchy Residue Theorem.\n",
